#### WELCOME TO EVERYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M CURRENTLY LEARNING
##### .         Up until now, I've had the basics of networking with Linux (Kali) ,how websites work,programming language and github. I'm very interested in playing around with the Linux terminal and its applications.However, to build a strong foundation for my career, this knowledge is insufficient. Since I'm interested in ethical hacking (penetration testing), I've begun learning bug bounty hunting through online resources like Udemy, YouTube, and Google articles. In the course it includes the tools used for bug bounty hunting and penetration testing. I heard that bug hunting is the best place to start for a beginner to become a penetration tester.I also like to contribute to open source projects ,Which gives experience for a fresher to get his first job
#####  The "master hacker" named [Occupy the web](https://twitter.com/three_cube 'twitter') is an inspiration to all those starting their careers in cybersecurity.  I've even read the book [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://www.amazon.in/LINUX-BASICS-HACKERS-OccupyTheWeb/dp/1593278551) by the same author. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Linux. I truly appreciate his teaching style in his books.

I got a strong understanding of web security vulnerabilities such as **XSS, CSRF, IDOR, and SQL Injection**. My journey began with the book **Bug Bounty Bootcamp** by Vickie Li, where I gained foundational knowledge. I then reinforced my learning by practicing on **PortSwigger’s labs** and studying write-ups from experienced hackers, which helped me develop a deeper understanding of real-world attack scenarios.

Currently, I have paused **bug bounty hunting** to focus on **open-source contributions** that will enhance my skills and improve my chances of securing a good job during campus placements. While exploring open-source opportunities, I discovered **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**, an excellent program for beginners passionate about contributing to real-world projects. 

To prepare for GSoC, I started contributing to **VulnerableCode**, a project under the **AboutCode** organization. This project requires expertise in **Python, Django, API development, security, and web applications**—skills I am already familiar with but eager to master. Through my contributions, I have been truly amazed by the guidance and support provided by the mentors. Their insights not only help in resolving doubts but also provide valuable direction on how to contribute effectively.

As part of my learning journey, I have been diving deeper into **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to build and work with APIs efficiently. So far, I have successfully raised **two pull requests (PRs)** in the **VulnerableCode** project, marking my progress in open-source development.

This experience has been incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge while making meaningful contributions to the open-source community.
**I have raised third pull request**: The pr is about to fix an issue to expose severities in affectedbypackages field in api response of version 2. I also modified test cases, because of adding new feature. To make tests even good, my mentor asked me to update or add new test case for non-empty severity section.
So currently i'm working on to **add new test case**...
